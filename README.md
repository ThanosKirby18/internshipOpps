A SQL project to list internship opportunities. 

Advanced Java Topics

May 20, 2022

The purpose of this project is to put all of the things we learned about SQL to the test. This comes in the way of using SQL to make a list full of potential 
internships that we can potentially apply for in the near future. 

In this project we had to learn how to sort in SQL and how to Query all by our selves.
